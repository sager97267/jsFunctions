# jsFunctions
This is a repository of JavaScript Functions 

This Repo is a file storage of several JavaScript functions that I have created over my time learning JS
These are going to be mostly from Free Code Camp, but there are several resources I have used to 
learn JavaScript.
I feel that saving functions for future code is important because once you have a function, I can reuse it
in a number of different applications, especially if you are designing applications that have similar
uses
